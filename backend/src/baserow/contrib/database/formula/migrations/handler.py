        Migrates all formulas found in the database to the latest formula version.
        A formula migration is not like a normal database migration. A formula migration
        consists of the following steps:

        1. Find the oldest formula version in the db currently, stored in the
           FormulaField.version column.
        2. Get the list of migrations to get to the latest formula version.
        3. Loop over the list of migrations. Each migration specifies Q filter
           for each of the three "migration operations" that will be performed
           at the end. The Q filter says "to migrate past this version, this
           migration operation must be applied to these formulas".
        4. Now we have 3 querysets of formulas to apply the following operations
           too to actually perform the migration:
            1. Rebuild the formula's field dependencies.
            2. Recalculate the formula's internal attributes: re-type it, transform it,
               save the results onto the FormulaField model.
            3. Recalculate the formula's cell values given its recalculated attributes.
        5. Finally once we've applied the operations above to the relevant formulas we
           update their FormulaField.version column to the latest version.

        We don't perform a normal database migration to do this because:
        A Django migration cannot rely on code outside of it's file which might
        change. The formula code is large and complex, we can't copy it into each
        migration to ensure the migration will always work.

        Instead a formula migration is set of recalculations/updates per formula in the
        db given the current state of the code.
